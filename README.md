## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pixel Perfect

### What I learned

It was a good challenge to refresh my knowledge of using hover effects and media queries to add a mobile version of the card.

Also I'm back to SCSS and it's awesome, my work with styles is more comfortable and effective now.

Pixel Perfect is a great tool to check how my work matches with the layout and I'm quite satisfied this time with the result.

### Continued development

Have plans to learn more about media queries and responsive design.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - There are basic info and simple working examples.
- [W3 Schools  Hover ](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - There is a good guide to refresh hover effect syntax.
